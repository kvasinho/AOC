# Advent of Code 2023 - TDD Version.

With Advent of Code 2024 just around the corner, and with no points left to earn on the 2023 leaderboard, this project focuses on solving each day’s challenge using a TDD approach. 
Since we can’t gain any points for 2023 anyway, I decided to shift my focus to make it Test driven, documented and formatted. 
This project is mainly a learning opportunity for myself to get used to TDD rather than finding the most eficient solutions. 

### Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

.NET SDK (version X.X.X)
A code editor like Visual Studio or VS Code if you want to execute the tets. 

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advent-of-code-2023-tdd.git
cd advent-of-code-2023-tdd
```

### Installing

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/kvasinho/advent-of-code-2023-tdd.git
cd advent-of-code-2023-tdd
```
2. Restore the project dependencies:
 
```
dotnet restore
```

3. Build the project:

```
dotnet build
```
4. Run a specific day's solution:

```
dotnet run --project DayX/DayX.csproj
```


## Running the tests

To run the automated tests for this system, navigate to the project directory and use the following command:


```
dotnet test
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### Built With
